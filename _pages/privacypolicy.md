# English
The app 'AdSense++' does generelly not collect any private information. All data is only stored on the device.

## Google Login
To access the displayed data in the app, the app needs permission to your Google accounts AdSense and AdMob data. This is done via the OAuth2 protocol. No access data leaves your devices. Except if you have the iCloud keychain enabled. Then authentication tokens are shared with your devices. No user data is ever transfered to a third party by the app.

## Analytics 
For product improvement and optimization purposes of the app, the version number of the app is used for statistical evaluation of user access. It is sent to a server in Frankfurt (Germany). During the transfer, your IP address will be anonymized by shortening. The transmission takes place via an SSL-encrypted connection. If you have any further questions about your data, please contact me.
